# 👷 The Team

\
**Let's get started with the most important person, our Main Dev: Trendespresso**\

****_Hey guys, Trendespresso here. I first got introduced to cryptocurrencies in late summer 2017 when a group of friends started discussing “these new revolutionary money projects that everybody and nobody owned.” I kept hearing the words “Ethereum,” “Cardano,” “blockchain,” and “crypto.” Over the next few weeks, I asked question after question to my friends and Googled a bunch more. There I found myself in September 2017 hitting the big green button on Ethereum. What a time! My roommates also started investing in crypto around the same time but after getting brutally burned in 2018 I was the only one who stuck around. The quiet years are the best time to acquire long-term holdings. Late 2020 brought a new bull run and with it all the stress I vividly felt in late 2017. I was determined to learn the craft of trading to have a more active role in my investments and to better stay up-to-date on the market. Having never traded before I scoured the internet for the best trading strategies. Nothing really clicked until I found The Baked Potato and his Triple Confirmation strategy in early 2021. WOW! I was so impassioned by my trading results and the incredibly welcoming Crypto Yams community that I went all-in coding the TC signal into TradingView. One thing led to another and here I am coding the entire strategy as a standalone platform. I’m totally stoked for us to take the TC community to the top. From one Yam to another: LFG!_

**Let's continue with the glorious BakedPotato, the Creator of the Triple Confirmation and our Community Growth Manager.**\

****<mark style="color:red;">****</mark>_Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to read our stories; it means a lot to all of us here that you know who we are and how we got involved in this all. This is my story; My crypto journey started in 2016-2017 when the bull market was kicking off. I had friends who talked about it nonstop, and I was eager to learn. I’ll be honest when I first started trading; I knew nothing literally… I listened to chillers, got into complete crap coins and ICO’s, and I lost more than just money. This new obsession with becoming great drove away relationships, my time, and my love life. I hadn’t realized that I needed balance in my life and my trading. But I’m a persistent person; I kept pushing myself, learning, expanding my knowledge, and realizing the amount of sharable content out in the space was lacking.. in better words. I drove myself to become the trader I am today, and I wanted to share what I had found with as many people as possible because I knew the trading struggle for most people. With many others’ help, we built this community from nothing but an idea and a few indicators._

**Who's missing? AHH, yes! SlumdogE, what can I say? He holds everything together.**

_“Herzlich Willkommen y’all”_, SlumdogE here. This greeting explains my life pretty well, as I moved from Germany to the USA about four years ago. My first experience with Crypto was on Silkroad and the “dark web”, I didn’t really take it seriously back then. I never thought that I would find a community that will change my life ten years later. But what have I done in the ten years in between? I worked in the hospitality industry, that was my life. I trained as a hotel manager, barista, bartender, and chef. Over the years, I privately taught myself website design, graphic design, and coding. A few years later, I discovered a love for charities and non-profits and turned my hobby into a career. The company “Charketing” was born; this company specialized in providing websites and other marketing materials to nonprofits at low cost or even free of charge. One thing led to another, and I was elected as a board member of an international volunteer organization; pretty much at the same time, I rediscovered crypto for myself and found old wallets again, which of course, were now worth a lot more. I quickly realized that I could build a new life for myself without the shackles of the private sector, so I went to Texas for a year to volunteer in a camp for disadvantaged youth. There I met my future wife and decided to stay here in the USA after we started dating. At the end of 2020, I found BakedPotato on Youtube by accident and immediately realized what a good and honest person BakedPotato was; one thing led to another and I ended up on the then BakedPotato discord server and immediately tried to help him to turn this community into something even greater. Together with the help of the community, we created the “Crypto Yams,” after that I programmed the “Triple Confirmation A”-Tradingview Indicator, which Trendespresso perfected, which made the Triple Confirmation Strategy even better additionally we as a community created the “Crypto Yam Sessions,” which then became a podcast, which until today offers new content 3 days a week. The idea to automate Potato’s strategy was born when we saw the great success of our community every day. And here we are, with our first community token and on our way to catapult “Crypto Trading” to new heights. I am excited to see what we can achieve together and even more excited to meet every one of you and your stories.\ <mark style="color:red;">****</mark>\ <mark style="color:red;">****</mark>More Information on [https://tripleconfirmation.com](https://tripleconfirmation.com)
