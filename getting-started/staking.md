# âš– Staking

To stake your `TCC` for 69% APR in tcPOT just click on this link:\
[https://staking.tripleconfirmation.com/](https://tripleconfirmation.com/stakes/tcctcpot/)\
\
The Site should look like this:\
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" data-size="original">

\
The first important step here is to click on the white/greyish popup:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

Click to connect to the Avalanche Mainnet C-Chain, **every time this window pops up, click it again**, some Browsers can cause a Bug where you need to connect multiple times sometimes.\
\
After that is done, click on **"Create Stake"**\
\
Now you should see this popup:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

First, you need to approve Funds for the Smart Contract, so basically what you want to stake.\
Type in the Amount, and click on "Approve Funds", make sure to have AVAX cover the gas fees.\
Confirm the Transaction in your Metamask and wait for the Transaction to be done.\
\
Now you should see this popup:\
![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Here you specify how much TCC you want to stake, type in the Amount and click on "Create Stake". Confirm the Transaction in your Metamask and wait for Completion.\
\
And that's it. ðŸŽ‰\
If your stake does not show up after completion of the transaction, just reload the site.\
\
**You can end your Stake at any time** without any fees besides the gas to cover the transaction.\
You see your tcPOT Rewards next to your stake, it's highlighted in purple:\
\
It should look like that:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**Each Stake is by itself; you cannot add to your stake**; if you want to stake more, you need to create another stake. For you as a user, this has mainly the benefit of Transaction Tracking. So each "Creating of a Stake" and the Rewards of that Stake are separate Transactions by themselves; this makes it way easier for your Tax-Person or yourself to track the Investment and your Reward. On the other hand, it has the benefit that the Smart Contract can **ONLY ACCESS what you approved** to give to the Smart Contract.\
