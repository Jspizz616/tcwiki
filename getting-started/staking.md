TCC Staking User Friendly Features
Transaction Tracking - Each Stake is by itself; you cannot add to your Stake; if you want to Stake more, you need to create another Stake. So each "Creating of a Stake" and the Rewards of that Stake are separate Transactions by themselves. This makes it way easier for your Tax-Person or yourself to track the Investment and your Reward.
Privacy Prioritization - TCC Staking has the privacy benefit that the Smart Contract can ONLY ACCESS what you approved to give to the Smart Contract.

How do I obtain the TCC token?
