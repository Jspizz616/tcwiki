# ðŸ’° Metamask Wallet

**If you don't want to insert your** [amity-wallet.md](amity-wallet.md "mention") **into your Metamask SKIP STEP 1:**\
All Steps require, of course, that you have the Metamask Wallet installed.\
If you didn't install Metamask yet, please do it here: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io)\
\
**Step 1:**\
Remember when you saved your [amity-wallet.md](amity-wallet.md "mention") Private key?\
Time to use that now.\
Click on the little circle on the top right corner of your Metamask, it should look like that, or similar: \
<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="" data-size="original">\
After that click on `Import Account`.\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)\
Enter your [amity-wallet.md](amity-wallet.md "mention") Private key and click on `Import`.\
Follow the steps in Metamask, _if there are any._\
__Now you have your Amity Wallet from our Discord Server in your Metamask, too.\
And the Balance is synced up.

\
**Step 2:**\
Now, we need to add `TCC` and `tcPOT` to your Metamask of course.\
Click on Assets, scroll down to "Import Tokens", and click it.\
From there click on "Custom Token" an insert: \
`0xFAA9c23BB4826201BF048C10B4B8A759B866cD61` for TCC\
`0xEF90D48797D0589167Bb0E2A7294d01d703258C4` for tcPOT\
\
**Click on "Add Custom Token"**\
Follow the steps in Metamask, _if there are any._\
__\
_From here, you can do whatever you like with your TCC and tcPOT, send it to your Main-Account, send it to Friends,_ [trade.md](trade.md "mention"), use your TCC for [staking.md](staking.md "mention"), and provide Liquidity for our [liquidity-pools.md](liquidity-pools.md "mention") or use it in our [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") NFTs.\
\
And don't forget our upcoming [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), you'll need all TC Ecosystem Tokens for that!\
