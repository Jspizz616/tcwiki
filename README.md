# üìë Our Story

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llj8lzfAW5w" %}

The Baked Potato is one of our co-founders and an experienced freelance technical analyst. After nearly a decade of learning stuff & things, he perfected his Triple Confirmation strategy, an ingenious and unparalleled method for identifying high success rate entry-and-exit points of momentum trades.

After a time of extremely successful wealth building and creativity, Master Potato decided to share with the world his incredible method. He formed a Discord community as well as a YouTube channel, both of which have thousands of subscribers. Potato continued to build the community around his strategy, and with the assistance of our other founder Slumdoge, created corresponding indicators for Trading View. The system matured and improved with the help of the community, growing organically.

The strategy is so foolproof and structured that it was almost a given that it would be the foundation for a fully automated trading bot. We started coding the bot with the support of the TC community, and because of their significant contributions we developed a way to reward them, and the Triple Confirmation Community (TCC) token was born.

TCC had its roots in our Discord, where we played text-based games with rewards given in a virtual discord token. We thought ‚ÄúHey, why not turn this into a cryptocurrency and give it an actual use case?‚Äù. **These use cases will include utilization for our upcoming NFT collection code-named ‚ÄúPot-Heads‚Äù, on-chain mini-games to earn more TCC tokens, rewarding our community for participation, as well as a general community economy **_**(think LP pools and staking)**_**.**

Community is what created all of this. Our community deserves its token, its playground, so we can play and earn together. And in the end, you‚Äôll be able to exchange your TCC token for our upcoming Trading-Bot token, the TC token. So, you better hold on to it!

Happy Trading, Degens!\
